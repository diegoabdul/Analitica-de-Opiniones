Hacienda Terra Taino is an oasis of tranquility in a beautiful nature setting away from the noisy traffic yet very close to the most beautiful beaches of Samana Island and the bustling nightlife of Las Terrenas. The hosts Carmen and Matt were super host per excellence, I wished I could have stayed longer but will for sure come back to escape the noisy day to day life in Santo Domingo. Muchas gracias por su hospidalidad, todo era exelente y el desayuno yo lo echo de memos.
